    <h3>HOLLAND'S FAMILY CHEESE</h3>

    Marieke started making an authentic Dutch cheese on her farmstead in 2006. The Gouda is crafted from milk that is pumped directly from their milking parlor into the cheese vat... fresh and warm! This means the cheese is made without preheating or pasteurizing. After two hours of pressing into 18 pound wheels, the Gouda is placed in a salt-brine for 60 hours. From there, each wheel is moved to our special curing cellar to reach the ideal age...starting from smooth and creamy after 60 days to sharp and more complex flavors as the Gouda ages for three years or more. Featured in March 2013.<br>

    <h3>OTTER CREEK ORGANIC FARM</h3>

    The 2008 Organic Farm of the Year, Otter Creek Organic Farm offers seasonal, raw milk cheddar cheese in block or beautiful retail packaging. Otter Creek also produces the 2007 ACS and US Championship Cheese award-winning Pesto Cheddar. These cheeses are made from a single farm with a herd of less than 200 cows, so this is inherently a unique product. Made by a Master Cheesemaker, unpasteurized, and naturally aged at least six months (frequently over a year), the cheeses are rich, full-flavored, and unusually creamy. Otter Creek's organic fields are the pastures where 180 farmstead Holsteins graze, and the milk these cows produce is used to make seasonal cheddars. These cheddars taste like the seasons—they are made locally with pride by the Master Cheesemaker at prize-winning Cedar Grove Cheese. Each season's cheddar has a unique flavor and fat content&mdash;they are all very different. Otter Creek's cheeses also include a special pesto cheddar.<br>
